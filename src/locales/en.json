    "streamingView4": "Live streaming allows the consumption of multimedia content over the Internet. This technology is capable of receiving and sending video and audio data that flows continuously through the network. This allows the user to start viewing the content as soon as the first data is received. In the case of an event, the user can watch it in real time, as the data is transmitted as the event unfolds.",
    "streamingView5": "In order for the event to be transmitted online, the live broadcast bundles the data into packets that are sent over the Internet. They usually pass through a streaming server, which then distributes them to the user. These data packets are the ones that reach the device of the different users and are sorted so that they are played correctly. When the device obtains all the data packets necessary to guarantee a consecutive transmission, streaming begins."
